Your are in the COMMON directory of the MATLAB/Octave implementation of piecewise polynomial interpolation code
Here, we have the elementary interface classes which all the interpolants rely on.
These include the following:

A. CLASSES

    1. InterpolationPoints : Interface class for a set of sample points that will be used for constructing an interpolant
    2. Interpolant : Class defining the basic interface functions, constructor, and members for a polynomial interpolant
    3. Piecewise Interpolant : A collection of interpolants
