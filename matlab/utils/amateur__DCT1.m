%   Implementation of DCT-I. DCT transform of the first kind.
%   Refer WIKIPEDIA or <CS_DIR>/4_Notes/Discrete-cosine-transform.xoj for more
%   details. For a given sequence of values x[n], this computes the cosine
%   transform of an even extension about both the left and right ends.
%   
%   INPUTS:
%       x - A sequence of values for which DCT-1 has to be computed [Expect a
%       column vector. A row vector will produce an ERROR. Any vector with
%       length < 2 will also produce an error]
%       
%       NOTE: For a matrix input, a 2D DCT is used. TODO: Doing a columnwise DCT
%       is easy but not supported at the moment. This can be done easily by
%       adding a mode
%
%       mode (optional) - This can be left empty if the regular DCT is to be
%       computed. However, if we want to compute the DCT matrix by using the DFT
%       formula (without normalization), pass 'MODE_EXTENDED'  in mode
%   OUTPUTS:
%       x_dct - A sequence of DCT coefficients (same length as x)
%       T (optional) - The tranform matrix associated with the size of input x
%
%   NOTE: This code is experimental. It does not attain the complexity of
%   O{nlog(n)}, where n is the length of the vector x. This has a complecity of
%   O(n^2), which is probably good enough for the small scale experiments that
%   we are doing. For better efficiency (atleast better asymptotic efficiency)
%   use DFT instead with an appropriately extended sequence.
%
%   TRANSFORM:
%       X(k) = (x_{0} + ((-1)^k)*x_{N-1})/2 + ...
%           sum_{n=1}^{N-2} x(n)*cos(pi*n*k/(N-1))
%
%   MODIFIED: Feb 15, 2017
%   Extension to arbitrary number of dimensions (TODO:  Current implementation
%   takes O(n^2) time. We should get this down to O(n*log(n)))
